    AdIntelligence was a new platform product that not only managing Youtube video ads, but also having the capability to integrate with other social platform,
    such as Facebook and Twitter ...  This project was a complete replacement of Media Audit Django (MA1).
    User management and authentication component was replaced by Cognito;
    Django RESTful API microservice was replaced by AppSync GraphQL API;
    PostgreSQL RDS was replaced by S3 data lake (Parquet, Glue, Athena), DynamoDB and Serverless Aurora.
    I was responsible for architecture design and technical project management, developer onboarding automation, CloudFormation and CircleCI CI/CD automation, and code reviews.
    The project is still under development.

    Base on the success of API Proxy prototype, the CTO and other developers convinced the potential of the serverless architecture.
    I was tasked to reinvent Media Audit ingestion workflow to address the django performance limitation.
    The new design decomposed original data ingestion workflow into multiple lambda, and also made use of S3 and Glue as data lake to
    store and catalog large amount of AdWords campaign performance data.
    This solution has significantly reduced the processing time and huge saving in storage cost.

    The company was suffering from Youtube Data API quota limitation, which constrained video meta data consumption at scale.
    I proposed and prototyped an API Proxy solution which rotate and throttle multiple API keys using Redis and LUA script.
    The proxy execution logic was implemented with AWS lambda Go runtime, invoked by SQS event, driven by StepFunctions workflow.
    The complete solution is packaged with SAM for lambda, and CloudFormation for provisioning VPC and ElasticCache related resources.
    The solution has solved the physical limitation on API key quota and proved the advantage of serverless architecture.

    Media Audit was a Python Django application built by oversea contractors and it was having code merge and deployment complication.
    I was tasked to create and fully document a new Software Development Lifecycle Process,
    which covered from defining the Roles and Duties, Jira Sprint Management,
    Codebase Workflow Management based on GitFlow - branching and versioning with GitHub,
    Release Process Management - automation and communication.  After implementing the new SDLC process,
    time spent on preparing and releasing new code to multiple environments reduced from day to less than 30 minutes.
