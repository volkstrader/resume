Hence, reinvent AdWords performance report CSV ingestion workflow to address the django performance limitation, using serverless architecture. The new design decomposed original data ingestion workflow into multiple lambda triggered by S3 bucket events, SQS, SNS and StepFunction; using S3 and Glue as data lake to store and catalog large amount of AdWords campaign/Youtube video performance data. This solution has significantly reduced the processing time and huge saving in storage cost compare with pure PostgreSQL RDS storage.

The API Proxy solution combines multiple API keys into a single pool, using Redis and LUA script to rotate and throttle key usage. The proxy execution logic was implemented with AWS lambda Go runtime, invoked by SQS, and StepFunctions workflow. The complete solution was packaged with SAM for lambda, and CloudFormation for provisioning VPC and ElasticCache related resources. The solution has solved the physical limitation on API key quota restriction and proved the advantage of serverless architecture.
